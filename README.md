# Aviation Accidents Data Analysis and Prediction
Machine learning analysis of the National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident data to predict aircraft damage severity and identify key risk factors in commercial flights.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the National Transportation Safety Board's aviation accident dataset to look at patterns in aviation incidents and to develop predictive models for damage assessment. 
Using data analysis techniques, we identify potential critical factors that may lead to severe aircraft damage.
